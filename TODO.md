**TODO for the LenoxBot Recode:**
- [ ] Remove untranslated strings from the ?rank command
- [ ] Do the setGuild() method without the get and rewriting the variable. (makes much less code) for ?deleteevents-
- [ ] Check when you add a new key to the botsettingskeys, if it will be added in the DB
- [ ] Add command or add a new key to the settings.json for the moderator-log channel (on discord)
- [ ] Add ?startevent command
- [ ] Fix weather command
- [ ] Use fetchMember method everywhere
